<li>Endmyopia is a collection of set of methods which require you to be patient and follow them patiently. If that’s not for you, then Endmyopia is probably not the best option.</li>
<li>Endmyopia doesn’t completely guarantee a recovery. It is for you to take a decision whether you’d like to be a part of it or not.</li>
<li>Members have to look into topics of interest on their own with some help from others. Spammed requests for help, pleading for answers is not acceptable behaviour and it is requested that you behave maturely.</li>
<li><strong>Patience is key</strong>. Endmyopia will not be effective if it’s methods are followed for a short duration. Your eyes have taken a long time to worsen, and reversing the process will take a similar time.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Following the above are crucial to make Endmyopia more effective. It is extremely dependent on individual effort and requires you to read, research and adapt. Noone is there to spoon-feed you, although questions are accepted while ensuring the above are followed</em></p>
